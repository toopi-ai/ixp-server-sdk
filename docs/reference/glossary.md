# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms and concepts used throughout the IXP Server SDK documentation and codebase.

## A

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
A set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software applications. In IXP Server, APIs define how different components interact with each other.

**Authentication**
The process of verifying the identity of a user or system. IXP Server supports various authentication methods including JWT, OAuth, and session-based authentication.

**Authorization**
The process of determining what actions an authenticated user is allowed to perform. This is handled through middleware and security policies.

**Async/Await**
JavaScript syntax for handling asynchronous operations. IXP Server extensively uses async/await for non-blocking operations.

## B

**Blocking Operation**
An operation that prevents other code from executing until it completes. IXP Server is designed to minimize blocking operations through asynchronous programming.

## C

**Cache**
A temporary storage mechanism for frequently accessed data to improve performance. IXP Server supports memory, Redis, and Memcached caching.

**Component**
A reusable piece of UI or functionality that can be rendered and composed with other components. Components in IXP Server can be functional, class-based, static, or interactive.

**Configuration**
Settings and parameters that control how IXP Server behaves. Configuration can be provided through files, environment variables, or programmatically.

**Context**
An object that carries request-specific information throughout the request lifecycle, including user data, request parameters, and shared state.

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**
A security feature that allows or restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one serving the web page.

**CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**
The four basic operations for persistent storage. IXP Server provides utilities for implementing CRUD operations.

**Clustering**
Running multiple instances of an application across multiple CPU cores or machines to improve performance and reliability.

## D

**Database Pool**
A cache of database connections that can be reused across multiple requests to improve performance and manage resources efficiently.

**Dependency Injection**
A design pattern where dependencies are provided to a component rather than the component creating them itself. IXP Server uses this pattern for plugins and services.

**Docker**
A containerization platform that allows applications to run in isolated environments. IXP Server applications can be containerized with Docker.

## E

**Environment Variables**
System-level variables that can be used to configure applications without changing code. IXP Server uses environment variables for configuration.

**Express.js**
A popular Node.js web framework. IXP Server can integrate with Express.js applications and middleware.

## F

**Functional Component**
A component defined as a function that takes props and returns a rendered output. These are simpler than class components and are preferred for stateless logic.

## G

**Graceful Shutdown**
The process of cleanly stopping a server by finishing current requests and closing connections properly before terminating.

## H

**Handler**
A function that processes a specific type of request or event. In IXP Server, handlers are used for intents, middleware, and plugins.

**Health Check**
An endpoint or mechanism that reports the status and health of a running application, used for monitoring and load balancing.

**Hot Reload**
A development feature that automatically updates the running application when code changes are detected, without requiring a full restart.

**HTTP/HTTPS**
Protocols for transferring data over the web. HTTPS is the secure version that encrypts data in transit.

## I

**Intent**
A representation of a user's goal or purpose. In IXP Server, intents are used instead of traditional routes to handle user requests in a more semantic way.

**Intent Resolution**
The process of matching user input to the appropriate intent handler based on patterns, parameters, and context.

**Interceptor**
A type of middleware that can modify requests or responses as they pass through the system.

## J

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**

**JWT (JSON Web Token)**
A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties. IXP Server supports JWT for stateless authentication.

## K

**Keep-Alive**
An HTTP feature that allows multiple requests to be sent over a single TCP connection, improving performance.

## L

**Load Balancer**
A system that distributes incoming requests across multiple server instances to improve performance and reliability.

**Logging**
The practice of recording events, errors, and information about application behavior for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## M

**Middleware**
Software that sits between different components or layers of an application, often used for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and validation.

**Migration**
A script or process that modifies database schema or data structure, typically used when updating applications.

**Microservices**
An architectural pattern where applications are built as a collection of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.

**Mock Data**
Fake or simulated data used during development and testing to avoid dependencies on external systems.

## N

**Node.js**
A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing JavaScript to run on servers. IXP Server is built for Node.js.

**npm (Node Package Manager)**
The default package manager for Node.js, used to install and manage dependencies.

## O

**OAuth**
An open standard for access delegation, commonly used for token-based authentication and authorization.

**ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**
A technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages and relational databases.

## P

**Plugin**
A modular piece of software that adds specific functionality to IXP Server. Plugins can extend the server's capabilities without modifying core code.

**Promise**
A JavaScript object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

**Props (Properties)**
Data passed to components to configure their behavior and appearance.

**Proxy**
An intermediary server that forwards requests from clients to other servers. Often used for load balancing and security.

## Q

**Query Parameter**
Data sent to a server as part of a URL, typically used for filtering, sorting, or configuring responses.

**Queue**
A data structure or system for managing tasks or messages in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner.

## R

**Rate Limiting**
A technique for controlling the number of requests a client can make to a server within a specific time period.

**Redis**
An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. IXP Server supports Redis for caching and sessions.

**REST (Representational State Transfer)**
An architectural style for designing networked applications, typically using HTTP methods and stateless communication.

**Route**
A URL pattern that maps to specific handler functions in traditional web frameworks. IXP Server uses intents instead of routes.

## S

**Schema**
A structure that defines the organization and constraints of data, often used for validation and documentation.

**SDK (Software Development Kit)**
A collection of tools, libraries, and documentation for developing applications. IXP Server SDK provides everything needed to build IXP applications.

**Serialization**
The process of converting objects or data structures into a format that can be stored or transmitted and later reconstructed.

**Session**
A way to store user-specific data across multiple requests, typically using cookies or tokens.
