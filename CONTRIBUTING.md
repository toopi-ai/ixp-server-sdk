## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ixp-server-sdk.git
   cd ixp-server-sdk
   ```

3. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup.js
   ```

   Or manually:
   ```bash
   npm install

## Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development mode with file watching
- `npm run build` - Build the project for production
- `npm run test` - Run the test suite
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run docs` - Generate documentation

### Development Mode

For active development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
- Watch for file changes
- Automatically rebuild on changes
- Run type checking
- Show build errors in real-time

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- ComponentRegistry.test.ts
```

### Writing Tests

- Place test files next to the source files with `.test.ts` extension
- Use Jest for testing framework
- Follow the existing test patterns
- Aim for high test coverage (>90%)
- Include both unit tests and integration tests

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup
  });

  describe('methodName', () => {
    it('should do something when condition', () => {
      // Arrange
      // Act
      // Assert
    });
  });
});
```

## Code Style

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer explicit types over `any`
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use enums for constants
- Document public APIs with JSDoc

### ESLint and Prettier

The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Code Organization

- Keep files focused and small (< 300 lines)
- Use barrel exports (`index.ts`) for clean imports
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns (business logic, validation, etc.)

## Commit Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers using the automated release script:

```bash
# Patch release (1.0.0 -> 1.0.1)
node scripts/release.js patch

# Minor release (1.0.0 -> 1.1.0)
node scripts/release.js minor

```

The release process:
1. Runs all tests and checks
2. Builds the project
3. Updates version in package.json
4. Generates changelog
5. Creates git tag
6. Publishes to npm
7. Creates GitHub release
